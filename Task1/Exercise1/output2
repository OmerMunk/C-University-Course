Executing the Scalar Product exercise: 

Enter 1 for user typed inputs,
2 for file input (automatically chosen if the program runs with an input file ),
or any other key to exit 

Please enter a number, which will determine a size of 2 integer vectors, then enter the values of the vectors

What is the size of the vectors? 

Please enter the 4 values of the 1st vector

Please enter the 4 values of the 2st vector 

The vectors you entered: 

Vector 1: (8 ,9 ,-4 ,2)

Vector 2: (12 ,-15 ,3 ,6)

The scalar product of the two vectors is: 
-39
